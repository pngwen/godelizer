# godelizer
Compute the Godel number of any valid Godelian formula! (Or of any invalid one. It doesn't judge!)

The numbering system used here is the one described in Kurt Godel's 1930 paper,
"On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems."

Arithmetize your formulae and determine their set membership among the provables,
unless you can't!

NOTE: This will just give you the number. Proving set membership is left as an exercise
for the reader.
